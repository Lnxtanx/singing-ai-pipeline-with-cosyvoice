SEGMENT EXTRACTION NOTES
========================

REPEATING SECTIONS - NO NEED TO EXTRACT SEPARATELY:

1. Lines 32-41 (Part 5 & Part 6):
   - These are IDENTICAL to lines 11-20 (already extracted as segments)
   - REUSE the existing segment analysis for these parts
   - No need to extract/analyze again

2. Last 3 lines (repeated):
   - "Amigos para sempre vamos ser" appears 3 times at the end
   - Can reuse the same audio segment multiple times in final composition

EXTRACTED SEGMENTS:
===================

Part 1: 6-23s (trimmed to ~21.72s)
   - Lines 1-4 (Pegue minha mão... vem brincar)
   - 18 words extracted

Part 2: 22-36s
   - Lines 5-8 (Não terá rainha má... nos divertir)
   - 4 lines

Part 3: 35-53s (trimmed to ~51.46s)
   - Lines 9-12 (Com a giramila... sol brilhar)
   - 16 words (removed "as flores nasceram")

Part 4: 52-70s
   - Lines 13-17 (As flores nós vamos regar... vamos ser)
   - 5 lines

Part 5: REUSE Part 1 analysis (lines 11-20 repeat lines 1-10)
Part 6: REUSE Part 2 analysis

IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:
========================

For Spanish generation:
- Generate Spanish vocals for Parts 1-4 only
- For Part 5 & 6: Copy the Spanish audio from Parts 1 & 2
- For final repeated lines: Copy/loop the same Spanish audio segment

This saves processing time and ensures consistency across repeated sections!
